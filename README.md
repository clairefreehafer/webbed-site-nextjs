# my personal website

source code for my personal website, which can be viewed live [here](https://clairefreehafer.vercel.app).

this is mostly a web development hobby project, so it is constantly a work in progress and if you do decide to check it out i guarantee at least one thing will be broken and/or wonky. i also have not yet optimized it very well (/at all) for mobile devices.

the site is built using next.js, panda css, prisma, and vercel.
