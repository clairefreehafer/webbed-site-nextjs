#### ingredients

- 12 oz / 340 g (about 3 sticks) unsalted butter
- 6 oz / 170 g (about 1 c) ~72% dark chocolate, 🔪 finely chopped
- 16 oz / 450 g (about 2 1/4 c) granulated sugar
- 2 oz / 55 g (about 1/4 c packed) light brown sugar
- 1 3/4 tsp /4 g kosher salt (for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight)
- 6 large eggs, straight from the fridge
- 1/2 oz / 15 g (about 1 tablespoon) vanilla extract
- 1 tsp instant espresso powder
- 4 1/2 oz / 125 g (about 1 c) all-purpose flour
- 4 oz / 115 g (about 1 1/3 c spooned) dutch-process cocoa powder

#### instructions

1. adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 🔥 350°F.

1. line a 9- by 13- by 2-inch anodized aluminum baking pan with foil to cover the bottom and long sides of the pan. optionally grease lightly with pan spray.

1. in a 3-quart stainless steel saucier, melt **butter** over 🔥 medium-low heat. when it has completely melted, increase heat to 🔥 medium and simmer, stirring with a heat-resistant spatula while butter hisses and pops. continue cooking and stirring, scraping up any brown bits that form inside the pan, until butter is golden yellow and perfectly silent (if butter burns, strain before using).

1. remove from heat and stir in **dark chocolate**; the mixture will seem quite thin.

1. combine **granulated sugar**, **brown sugar**, **salt**, **eggs**, **vanilla**, and **instant espresso** in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. whip on medium-high until extremely thick and fluffy, about ⏲️ 8 minutes. (the whipping time can vary significantly depending on bowl size, batter temperature, and mixer wattage, so use the visual cues as your primary guide.)

1. sift together **flour** and **cocoa powder**. when the foamed eggs are fluffy and thick, reduce speed to low and pour in the warm chocolate-butter. once it is incorporated, add cocoa-flour mixture all at once and continue mixing until roughly combined. finish with a flexible spatula, scraping and folding to ensure batter is well mixed from the bottom up.

1. pour into prepared pan and bake until brownies are glossy and just barely firm, about ⏲️ 30 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 205°F. (take care that the probe is inserted at a sharp angle to avoid touching the bottom of the pan.) the timing of this recipe is based on anodized aluminum and will vary significantly with glass, ceramic, or nonstick pans, materials that will also affect the brownies' consistency.

1. cool brownies to room temperature to allow their crumb to set before slicing.

1. slide a butter knife between the brownies and the short ends of the pan; gently tug on the foil, then lift to remove the brownies from the pan. cut into 24 two-and-a-half-inch squares and store in an airtight container with a sheet of wax paper between layers, about 1 week at room temperature.
