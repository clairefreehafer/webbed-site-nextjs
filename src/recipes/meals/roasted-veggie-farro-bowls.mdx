#### ingredients

- 1.5 c farro
- veggie stock
- 2 yellow onions, sliced into 1-inch-thick wedges
- 4 sweet potatoes, diced Â½-inch
- 2 tsp chili powder
- 2 lemons, one zested and both quartered
- 2 oz dried cranberries
- 4 oz arugula
- 1/2 c parmesan cheese
- 1 oz salsa verde sunflower pepitas
- 2 tsp sugar
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 tbsp olive oil

#### instructions

1. place a lightly oiled baking sheet on top rack and preheat oven to 425 degrees. in a medium pot, combine **farro**, **stock** concentrate, and 6 cups **water**. bring to a boil and cook until farro is tender, 25-30 minutes. if you end up with any excess stock, simply pour it out. alternatively, if stock evaporates before farro is done, add a splash of water.

2. in a large bowl, toss **onion** and **sweet potato** with a large drizzle of **oil**, **chili powder**, **salt**, and **pepper**. carefully spread out on preheated baking sheet. roast on top rack until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes.

3. in a small bowl, combine juice from four **lemon wedges** and 2 tsp **sugar**. stir in **cranberries**. let marinate, stirring occasionally, at least 15 minutes.

4. once cranberries have marinated, transfer lemon juice marinade to a second large bowl (leaving cranberries in small bowl). whisk 2 tbsp **olive oil** into bowl with marinade; taste and season with **salt** and **pepper**.

5. stir 4 tbsp **butter**, half the roasted veggies, and half the dressing into pot with farro. season with **salt** and **pepper**. to bowl with remaining dressing, add **arugula**, **cranberries**, and remaining roasted veggies; toss to coat. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

6. divide farro mixture between bowls. top with salad. sprinkle with **parmesan**, **pepitas**, and as much **lemon zest** as you like. serve with remaining **lemon wedges** on the side.
