#### ingredients

- 18 oz spinach ricotta ravioli
- 2 zucchini
- 2 tomatoes, diced
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced, separated
- 1 lemon, zested and quartered
- 1 tbsp italian seasoning
- veggie stock
- 6 tbsp sour cream
- 6 tbsp parmesan cheese
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp butter

#### instructions

1. bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. trim ends from **zucchini**; shave zucchini lengthwise into thin ribbons using a peeler, rotating as you go, until you get to the seedy core. finely chop core.

2. once water is boiling, gently add **ravioli** to pot. immediately reduce to a low simmer. cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente and floating to the top, 4-5 minutes. gently shake strainer with ravioli in it to remove as much moisture as possible. reserve 1 cup **pasta cooking water**, then drain.

3. meanwhile, heat a large drizzle of **olive oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add **chopped zucchini**, **tomato**, **scallion whites**, and 2 tsp **italian seasoning**. cook until veggies are just softened, 1-2 minutes. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

4. reduce heat under pan with veggies to medium, then stir in stock concentrate, 1/3 cup reserved **pasta cooking water**, and a squeeze of **lemon juice**. reduce heat to low and cook, 1-2 minutes. stir in **sour cream** and 2 tbsp **butter** until melted and combined. season with **salt** and **pepper**. if needed, stir in more reserved cooking water a splash at a time until sauce reaches a creamy consistency.

5. separate **zucchini ribbons** with your hands, then stir into pan with sauce. gently stir in drained **ravioli**. simmer until sauce has thickened, 1-2 minutes. season with **salt** and **pepper**. stir in **lemon zest** to taste.

6. divide pasta between bowls. garnish with **scallion greens** and **parmesan**. serve with remaining **lemon wedges** on the side.
