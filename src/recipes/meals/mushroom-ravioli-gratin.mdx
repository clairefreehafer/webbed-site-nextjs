#### ingredients

- 18 oz mushroom ravioli
- 16 oz button mushrooms, thinly sliced
- 1 yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 1/2 oz thyme leaves
- veggie stock
- ¼ c panko breadcrumbs
- 1/2 c parmesan cheese
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 4 tsp olive oil

#### instructions

1. preheat broiler to high or oven to 500 degrees. heat a drizzle of **olive oil** in a large pan over medium heat (use an ovenproof pan if you have one). add **mushrooms**, **onion**, and **thyme**. cook, tossing, until softened, 5-6 minutes. season with **salt** and **pepper**. stir in **stock** concentrate and 1½ cups **water**. bring to a simmer.

2. add **ravioli** to pan in an even layer. cover and cook 4 minutes. uncover and cook, spooning stock over ravioli occasionally, until tender, 5-6 minutes. if liquid evaporates before ravioli are tender, add a splash of water to pan. shake pan occasionally to keep ravioli from sticking.

3. while ravioli cook, combine ¼ cup **panko**, **parmesan**, a drizzle of **olive oil**, and a pinch of **salt** and **pepper** in a small bowl.

4. add **sour cream** to pan and gently stir to coat ravioli and create a thick sauce. if sauce seems dry, add a splash of water. season with **salt** and **pepper**. if your pan is not ovenproof, transfer mixture to a small baking dish at this point.

5. sprinkle crust mixture over ravioli. broil or bake until crust is golden and crisp, 1-2 minutes. divide between plates and serve.
