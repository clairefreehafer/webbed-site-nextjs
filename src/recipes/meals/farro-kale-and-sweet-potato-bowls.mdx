#### ingredients

- 1.5 c farro
- 2 sweet potatoes, diced into Â½-inch pieces
- 8 oz kale
- 8 oz red cabbage, shredded
- 4 tbsp mayonaise
- 1 tbsp harissa powder
- 1 oz pepitas
- veggie stock
- 1 tbsp fry seasoning
- 2 lemons, zested and halved
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 1 apple, diced
- 4 tsp olive oil
- 2 tsp sugar
- 4 tbsp butter

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. in a medium pot, combine **farro**, **stock** concentrate, and 6 cups **water**. bring to a boil and cook until farro is tender, 25-30 minutes. keep covered off heat until ready to serve. if you end up with any excess stock, simply pour it out. alternatively, if stock evaporates before farro is done, add a splash of water.

2. toss **sweet potato** on a baking sheet with the **fry seasoning** and a large drizzle of **olive oil**. season with **salt** and **pepper**. roast on top rack until golden brown and tender, 20-25 minutes.

3. in a medium microwave-safe bowl, combine **juice** from lemon and 2 tsp **sugar**; stir until sugar has dissolved. add **cabbage** and 4 tbsp **water**; toss to coat. microwave for 1 minute. season with **salt** and **pepper**. set aside, stirring occasionally, until ready to serve.

4. in a small bowl, combine **mayonnaise**, **sour cream**, as much **lemon zest** and **garlic** as you like, and **harissa powder** to taste. add **water** 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

5. remove and discard any large ribs from **kale**. heat a large drizzle of **olive oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add kale and season with **salt** and **pepper**. cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 5-7 minutes. stir in 2 tbsp **butter** until melted. remove pan from heat.

6. stir 2 tbsp **butter** into farro until melted. stir in diced **apple** and season with **salt** and **pepper**. divide farro between bowls and top with kale, pickled cabbage, and sweet potato. drizzle with dressing. sprinkle with **pepitas** and serve.
