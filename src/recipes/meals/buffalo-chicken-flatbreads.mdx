#### ingredients

- 2 flatbreads
- 10 oz chicken stir-fry
- 1 long green pepper, diced
- 1 roma tomato, diced
- 1 tsp celery salt
- 3 tsp ranch seasoning
- 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese
- 1 tsp honey
- 2 tsp hot sauce
- 1 tsp sriracha
- 2 tbsp sour cream
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 3 tbsp butter
- salt
- pepper

#### instructions

1. adjust oven rack to top position and preheat to 450 degrees with a baking sheet inside. pat chicken dry with a paper towel. in a medium bowl, toss **chicken** with **celery salt**, 1 tbsp **ranch seasoning**, and a few pinches of **salt** and **pepper**.

2. heat a drizzle of **olive oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat (use a nonstick pan if you have one). add **chicken** and **green peppers** and cook, stirring occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and peppers are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. season with **salt** and **pepper**, then remove to a plate.

3. reduce heat under same pan to medium. add **tomatoes** and 3 tbsp **water**. cook until tomatoes become slightly saucy, about 2 minutes. stir in 1 tbsp **butter** until melted, then season with **salt** and **pepper**.

4. remove baking sheet from oven; drizzle with **olive oil**, then place **flatbreads** on top. spoon tomato sauce evenly onto flatbreads, then scatter chicken mixture on top, followed by **mozzarella**. return sheet to oven and bake until flatbreads are crisped and cheese is melted, 8 to 10 minutes.

5. meanwhile, add 2 tbsp **butter** to a small microwave-safe bowl. microwave until just melted, about 30 seconds. stir in **honey**, **hot sauce**, and **sriracha** until well combined. in another small bowl, mix 2 tsp **ranch seasoning** with **sour cream**. add **water** 1 tsp at a time until you reach a drizzling consistency. season with **salt**.

6. once flatbreads are finished baking, remove sheet from oven. transfer flatbreads to a cutting board and slice. drizzle with **buffalo** and **ranch sauces** (or serve ranch on the side for dipping) and serve.
