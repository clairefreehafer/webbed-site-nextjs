#### ingredients

- 2 flatbreads
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- 4 oz pineapple (in juice)
- 5 tsp red wine vinegar
- 1 poblano pepper, thinly sliced
- 4 oz fresh mozzarella, diced (½-inch)
- ¼ cup monterey jack cheese, shredded
- 1/4 oz cilantro, finely chopped
- 2 oz BBQ sauce
- 1 tsp olive oil
- 4 tsp vegetable oil

#### instructions

1. place a foil-lined baking sheet on top rack (for 4 servings, 2 foil-lined sheets, on top and middle racks) and preheat oven to 450 degrees. drain **pineapple** over a small bowl, reserving **juice**. stir ¼ of the **onion**, half the **vinegar**, and a pinch of **salt** into bowl with juice. set aside.

2. heat a drizzle of **oil** in a large pan over medium heat. add remaining **onion** and cook, stirring and adding splashes of **water** as necessary to prevent sticking, until softened, 6-8 minutes.

3. toss **poblano** slices in a second small bowl with a drizzle of **olive oil**, **salt**, and **pepper**.

4. once cooked onion is softened, increase heat under pan to medium high. add **pineapple** and another drizzle of **oil**; cook, stirring, until pineapple is lightly browned, 2-3 minutes. stir in remaining **vinegar**. cook, stirring, until onion and pineapple are caramelized and jammy, 1-2 minutes more. turn off heat and season with **salt** and **pepper**.

5. brush or rub each **flatbread** with a drizzle of **oil**. remove prepared baking sheet from oven; carefully place flatbreads on it (for 4 servings, divide flatbreads between 2 prepared sheets). evenly spread with **BBQ sauce**, then top with **caramelized onion** and **pineapple**, **poblano**, **monterey jack**, and **mozzarella**.

6. return flatbreads to top rack until cheese has melted and edges are golden brown, 10-12 minutes. (for 4 servings, return to top and middle racks; swap rack positions halfway through baking.) transfer to a cutting board and top with **cilantro** and **pickled onion** (draining first) to taste. slice into pieces, divide between plates, and serve.
