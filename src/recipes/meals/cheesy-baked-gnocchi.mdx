#### ingredients

- chives, minced
- parsely, minced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 zucchinis, in ½-inch thick half-moons
- 2 demi-baguettes, halved lengthwise
- 8 oz ricotta cheese
- 17.6 oz gnocchi
- 28 oz marinara sauce
- 1 cup mozzarella cheese
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 6 tbsp butter

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to top position and heat broiler to high. bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil.

2. in a small bowl, combine **ricotta**, half the **chives** and **parsley**, a drizzle of **olive oil**, **salt**, and **pepper**. place 4 tbsp **butter** in a separate small microwave-safe bowl; microwave until melted, 30 seconds. stir in a pinch of **garlic** to taste; season with **salt** and **pepper**.

3. heat a drizzle of **olive oil** in a large, preferably ovenproof, pan over medium-high heat. add **zucchini**; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and tender, 5-7 minutes. add remaining **garlic**; cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. season with **salt** and **pepper**; transfer to a plate. meanwhile, add **gnocchi** to pot of boiling water. cook until tender, 3-4 minutes. Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water, then drain.

4. heat a drizzle of **olive oil** in pan used for **zucchini** over medium heat. pour in **marinara sauce**; bring to a simmer. stir in cooked gnocchi, 2 tbsp **plain butter**, and a pinch of **salt** and **pepper**. if needed, stir in reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until gnocchi is coated in sauce. if your pan isn’t ovenproof, transfer mixture now to a baking dish.

5. scatter zucchini over gnocchi mixture, then sprinkle with **mozzarella**. broil until cheese is bubbly and lightly browned, 2-3 minutes. remove from oven; let cool slightly. meanwhile, place **baguette** halves on a baking sheet; brush cut sides with **garlic butter**. broil on top rack until golden brown, 1-2 minutes. (watch carefully to avoid burning.)

6. halve garlic bread on a diagonal. dollop baked gnocchi with herby **ricotta**. sprinkle with remaining **chives** and **parsley**. serve straight from the pan (or dish) with garlic bread on the side.
