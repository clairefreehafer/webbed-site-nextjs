#### ingredients

- 4 portobello mushrooms
- 2 zucchini, in ½-inch-thick half-moons
- 2 tsp italian seasoning
- 12 oz spaghetti
- 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 28 oz marinara sauce
- 1 cup mozzarella cheese
- 9 tsp olive oil
- 3 tbsp butter

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to top and middle positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees. bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. line two baking sheets with foil. using the tip of a spoon, gently scrape and remove black gills from undersides of portobello mushrooms; trim any large stems, if necessary. trim and halve zucchini lengthwise; cut crosswise into ½-inch-thick half-moons.

2. toss **zucchini** on one side of prepared baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, 1 tsp **italian seasoning**, **salt**, and **pepper**. drizzle both sides of each **mushroom** with **olive oil**; rub to evenly coat. season all over with **salt**, **pepper**, and 1 tsp **italian seasoning**. arrange mushrooms gill sides down on empty side of same sheet. roast zucchini on top and mushrooms on middle rack rack until tender, 14-16 minutes.

3. once water is boiling, add **spaghetti** to pot. cook until al dente, 9-11 minutes. reserve ½ cup **pasta cooking water**, then drain.

4. meanwhile, melt 2 tbsp **butter** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add **panko**. cook, stirring, until golden brown, 3-5 minutes. season with **salt** and **pepper**. turn off heat; transfer to a small bowl. wipe out pan. return same pan to medium heat; pour in **marinara**. bring to a simmer; cook, stirring occasionally, until warmed through, 2-3 minutes. turn off heat. reserve ½ cup marinara.

5. once veggies are tender, remove baking sheet from oven and transfer zucchini to pan with sauce. flip mushrooms on sheet. heat broiler to high. stir spaghetti and 1 tbsp **butter** into sauce. spoon reserved marinara into mushrooms, then mound evenly with **mozzarella**. broil on top rack until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 2-4 minutes. watch carefully to avoid burning.

6. if needed, stir reserved **pasta cooking water** a splash at a time into pan with spaghetti over low heat until pasta is thoroughly coated in sauce. taste and season with **salt** and **pepper**. divide spaghetti between plates and top with cheesy mushrooms. sprinkle with **toasted breadcrumbs** and serve.
