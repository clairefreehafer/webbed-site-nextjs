#### instructions

1. preheat the oven to 300 degrees. crush 1 sliced **garlic** clove and a pinch of **salt** together in a mortar or small bowl, and stir in 1/4 c **olive oil**. tear **bread** into about 2-inch pieces, and spread out on a baking sheet. drizzle over the garlic oil, and toss to combine. bake in the preheated oven until bread is dried out and getting crisp on the edges, 25 to 30 minutes.

2. transfer 1 can **beans** into a mixing bowl, and mash with a potato masher until almost smooth. add canned **tomatoes**, and use the masher to break into very small pieces. set aside.

3. add 2 tbsp **olive oil** to a soup pot set over medium-high heat. saut√© **onions**, **carrots**, and **celery** with a big pinch of **salt** until onions start to turn translucent, about 4 minutes. add 3 cloves minced **garlic**, **oregano**, **thyme**, **rosemary**, and **bay leaf**, and cook, stirring, for another minute.

4. add **chicken broth**. use about 1/2 cup **water** to rinse out the tomato can and add to the soup. bring to simmer over high heat, then reduce to medium-low, and simmer for about 10 minutes.

5. raise the heat back to high; when the soup is boiling, stir in **kale** and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

6. add in **parsley**, remaining can of **beans**, crushed bean and tomato mixture, **black pepper**, and **cayenne**. rinse the tomato bowl with about 1 cup **water**, and add that to the soup. transfer in half the **bread**, and 1/4 cup **parmesan cheese**. stir everything to combine. when mixture comes back to a simmer, reduce heat to medium, and simmer until greens are very tender, stirring occasionally, about 15 minutes. taste for seasoning and add more salt if needed.

7. turn off heat, and add half of the remaining **bread** to the top. use a spoon or spatula to poke some bread into the surface.

8. ladle soup into serving bowls; top with the extra toasted bread, a generous grating of **parmesan cheese**, **red chili flakes**, freshly chopped **parsley**, and a drizzle of **olive oil**. fresh **lemon juice** can also be squeezed over.
