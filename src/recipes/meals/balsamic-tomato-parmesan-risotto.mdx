#### ingredients

- 3/4 cup arborio rice
- 2 scallions
- 1 zucchini
- 4 oz grape tomatoes
- 1 tbsp tuscan heat spice
- (2) veggie stock concentrate
- 5 tsp basil oil
- 5 tsp balsamic vinegar
- 1/4 cup parmesan cheese
- 1 tsp vegetable oil
- 1 tbsp butter
- salt
- pepper

#### instructions

1. in a medium pot, combine 4 cups **water** (7 cups for 4 servings) and **stock concentrates**. bring to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer. meanwhile, wash and dry all produce. trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.

2. heat a drizzle of **oil** in a large pan over medium heat. add **scallion whites**; cook until softened, 1 minute. add **rice** and 2 tsp **tuscan heat spice** (4 tsp for 4 servings). stir until rice is translucent, 1-2 minutes. add ½ cup **stock**; stir until liquid has mostly absorbed. repeat with remaining stock—adding ½ cup at a time and stirring until liquid has mostly absorbed—until rice is al dente and mixture is creamy, 25-30 minutes.

3. once risotto has cooked 20 minutes, halve **tomatoes**. trim and dice **zucchini** into ½-inch pieces. heat 1 tsp **basil oil** (2 tsp for 4 servings; save the rest for serving) in a second large pan over medium-high heat. add **zucchini** and remaining **tuscan heat spice**. cook, stirring, until tender and lightly browned, 4-6 minutes.

4. add tomatoes and half the **vinegar** (all for 4 servings) to pan with zucchini. cook, stirring, until tomatoes have softened, 2-3 minutes. season with salt and pepper. turn off heat.

5. once risotto is done, stir in 1 tbsp **butter** (2 tbsp for 4 servings) and half the **parmesan** (save the rest for serving). taste and season with **salt** and **pepper**.

6. divide risotto between bowls. top with veggies, **scallion greens**, and remaining **parmesan**. drizzle with remaining **basil oil** to taste and serve.
