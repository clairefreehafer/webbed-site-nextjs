- 2 tbsp sesame oil
- 4 tbsp soy sauce

#### instructions

1. using a peeler, shave **carrot** lengthwise into ribbons, rotating as you go, until you get to the core; discard core.

2. heat a drizzle of **oil** in a small pot over medium-high heat. add **ginger** and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds. stir in **rice**, 2¼ cups **water**, and a pinch of **salt**. bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. keep covered off heat until ready to serve.

3. while rice cooks, in a small bowl, combine **scallion whites**, **vinegar**, and a pinch of **salt**; set aside to pickle. in a separate small bowl, combine **sesame oil**, **soy sauce**, 2 tbsp **sugar**, and up to half the **sriracha**.

4. heat a drizzle of **oil** in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. add **carrot** and season with **salt** and **pepper**. cook, stirring, until just tender, 3-4 minutes. transfer to a medium bowl. add **zucchini** and another drizzle of **oil** to pan. cook, stirring, until tender, 5-6 minutes. season with **salt** and **pepper**. transfer to bowl with carrot. add **mushrooms** and another drizzle of **oil** to pan. cook, stirring, until tender, 3-5 minutes. season with **salt** and **pepper**. turn off heat; transfer to same bowl. wipe out pan.

5. heat a drizzle of **oil** in same pan over medium heat. once hot, crack **eggs** into pan and cover. fry eggs to preference. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

6. fluff rice with a fork; season with **salt** and **pepper**. divide rice between bowls. arrange carrot, zucchini, and mushrooms on top. top each bowl with a fried egg and pickled scallion whites (draining first). drizzle with sauce and any remaining **sriracha** to taste. Sprinkle with **scallion greens** and serve.
