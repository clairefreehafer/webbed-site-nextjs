#### ingredients

- tortillas
- 16 oz ground beef
- 2 avocados
- 6 radishes, thinly sliced
- 2 red bell peppers, thinly sliced crosswise
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced
- 2 limes, cut into wedges
- 2 tsp southwest spice blend
- 8 tbsp sour cream

#### instructions

1. preheat oven to 400 degrees (you can skip this if youâ€™ll be warming your tortillas in the microwave)

2. halve, pit, and scoop flesh from avocado. chop roughly, then add to a small bowl, along with 1 tbsp **scallion greens** and a squeeze of **lime**. mash with fork until mostly smooth. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

3. heat a drizzle of **oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add **bell pepper** and cook, tossing, until softened and lightly charred, 5-6 minutes. stir in **scallion whites** and cook until just softened, 1 minute. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

4. wrap tortillas in foil and place in oven to warm, about 5 minutes. alternatively, wrap the tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave on high for 30 seconds. keep wrapped until ready to serve.

5. add **ground beef** and **southwest spice blend** to pan with peppers, breaking up meat into pieces with a spatula or wooden spoon. cook, tossing, until browned and cooked through, 4-5 minutes. carefully drain any excess grease from pan. season with **salt**, **pepper**, and a squeeze of **lime**.

6. spread guacamole on tortillas, then top each with beef mixture, **radishes**, a dollop of **sour cream**, and any remaining **scallion greens**. serve with **lime wedges** for squeezing over on the side.
