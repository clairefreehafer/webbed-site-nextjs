#### ingredients

- 12 flour tortillas
- 8 eggs
- 1 yellow onion, thinly sliced, 4 tbsp minced
- 2 long green peppers, thinly sliced into strips
- 2 roma tomatoes, diced
- ¼ oz cilantro, roughly chopped
- 2 limes, quartered
- 1 tbsp southwest spice blend
- 1 c mexican cheese Blend
- 6 tbsp sour cream
- 4 tsp smoked paprika
- 3 tbsp butter

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 400 degrees. in a small bowl, combine **tomato**, **minced onion**, **cilantro**, and **lime juice** to taste. season with **salt** and **pepper**. in a separate small bowl, combine 4 tsp **paprika** and **sour cream**. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

2. heat a drizzle of **oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add **sliced onion** and **green pepper**; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and charred, 6-8 minutes. stir in the **southwest spice blend** and a splash or two of **water** until veggies are coated. season with **salt** and **pepper**. cook until water has evaporated, 1-2 minutes. turn off heat. Transfer to a plate; cover to keep warm. wipe out pan.

3. place **tortillas** on a baking sheet in a single layer; sprinkle with **mexican cheese blend**. bake on middle rack until cheese melts, 1-2 minutes. don’t let these bake too long—they should be soft, not crisp.

4. crack **eggs** into a large bowl; whisk until combined. season generously with **salt** and **pepper**. melt 3 tbsp **butter** in pan used for veggies over medium heat. add eggs; cook, gently stirring in a figure-eight pattern, until curds form and eggs are cooked to preference. remove from heat.

5. divide cheesy tortillas between plates; fill with eggs and veggies. top tacos with pico de gallo and smoky crema. serve with any remaining **lime wedges** on the side.
