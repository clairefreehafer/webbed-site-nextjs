#### ingredients

- flour tortillas
- 26.8 oz chickpeas, drained, rinsed, and dried
- 2 avocados
- 2 bell peppers, cut into ½-in-wide strips
- 2 red onions, cut into ½-in-thick wedges, 6 tbsp finely diced
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced
- 2 limes, 1 tsp zested, quartered
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 2 tbsp southwest spice blend

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to upper position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. place **chickpeas** on a baking sheet, pushing toward one side, and toss with **southwest spice**, a drizzle of **olive oil**, and a pinch of **salt** and **pepper**. roast in oven until crisp, 20-25 minutes total.

2. after chickpeas have roasted for 5-10 minutes, remove baking sheet from oven and toss **bell pepper** and **onion wedges** with a drizzle of **olive oil** on the empty side of the same sheet. return sheet to oven and roast until veggies are tender and lightly browned, about 15 minutes.

3. scoop **avocado** flesh into a medium bowl. add 2 tbsp **diced onion** and **juice** from two lime quarters. season with **salt** and **pepper**. mash with a fork until mostly smooth. stir in **scallion whites** and half the **scallion greens**. taste and add more salt, lime juice, or diced onion, if desired.

4. wrap **tortillas** in foil and place in oven to warm, about 5 minutes. meanwhile, stir **lime zest**, **sour cream**, and a squeeze of **lime** in a small bowl. season with a pinch of **salt**.

5. spread guacamole onto tortillas. fill each with **chickpeas** and roasted veggies, then dollop with crema. garnish with remaining **scallion greens**. serve with any remaining **lime quarters** on the side.
