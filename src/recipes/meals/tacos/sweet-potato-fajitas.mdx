#### ingredients

- tortillas
- 4 sweet potatoes, cut into 1/2-in-thick wedges
- 2 roma tomatoes, diced
- 2 long green peppers, thinly sliced
- 2 red onions, 1/2 c diced, rest thinly sliced
- 1 jalapeño, thinly sliced into rounds
- 1 lime, zested and quartered
- 1/4 oz cilantro, roughly chopped
- 2 c pepper jack cheese, shredded
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 1 tbsp southwest spice blend

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. toss **sweet potatoes** on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of **oil** and 2 tsp **southwest spice**. season with **salt** and **pepper**. roast on top rack until tender and lightly crisped, 25-30 minutes.

2. in a small bowl, combine **jalapeño**, **juice** from half the lime, ½ tsp **sugar**, and a big pinch of **salt**. set aside to pickle, stirring occasionally, until ready to serve.

3. heat a large drizzle of **oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add sliced onion and green pepper. cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly charred, 8-10 minutes. add a splash of water if veggies begin to brown too quickly. season with **salt** and **pepper**. remove pan from heat.

4. in a second small bowl, combine **tomato**, **cilantro**, diced **onion**, and a squeeze of **lime juice**. season with **salt** and **pepper**. in a third small bowl, combine **sour cream**, **lime zest**, and a squeeze of **lime juice**. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

5. wrap **tortillas** in damp paper towels and microwave until warm and pliable, 30 seconds. divide tortillas between plates and fill with sweet potatoes, veggies, **pepper jack**, salsa, lime sour cream, and as much pickled jalapeño (draining first) as you like. serve with any remaining **lime wedges** on the side.
