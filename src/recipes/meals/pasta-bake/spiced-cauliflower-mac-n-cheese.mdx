  - 2 part cumin
  - 2 part garlic powder

  - .25 part ground allspice
  - .25 part chili flakes

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. toss **cauliflower** on a baking sheet with a drizzle of **olive oil**. season with **salt**, **pepper**, and ½ tsp **turkish spice**. roast cauliflower in oven until tender and lightly browned, about 25 minutes.

2. once water is boiling, add **gemelli** to pot. cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-12 minutes, then drain.

3. melt **butter** in a large pan over medium-high heat (use an ovenproof pan if you have one). add **onion** and **scallion whites**. cook, tossing, until softened, 3-5 minutes. stir in another ½ tsp **turkish spice** and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. sprinkle **flour** into pan and cook, stirring, until it loses its raw smell, 1-2 minutes.

4. slowly whisk 2 cup **milk** into pan. stir in **stock concentrate** and bring to a simmer. let bubble until thickened, about 2 minutes. remove from heat and add **cheese**, stirring to melt. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

5. stir gemelli and cauliflower into pan. transfer mixture to a baking dish at this point if your pan isn’t ovenproof. transfer pan to oven and bake until crisp on top, about 5 minutes. toss **lettuce** with **vinegar** and a drizzle of **olive oil** in a large bowl. divide pasta between plates and sprinkle with **scallion greens**. serve salad on the side.
