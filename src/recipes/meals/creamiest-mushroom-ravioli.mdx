#### ingredients

- 18 oz mushroom ravioli
- 8 oz button mushrooms, sliced ¼-inch thick
- 8 oz heirloom grape tomatoes, halved
- 2 shallot, thinly sliced
- mushroom stock concentrate
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese
- 2 tsp chili flakes
- 1/2 oz parlsey leaves, a few whole for garnish, the rest finely chopped
- 1 tbsp olive oil

#### instructions

1. bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. once water is boiling, add **ravioli** to pot. reduce heat to low. cook until tender and floating to the top, 3-4 minutes. carefully reserve 1 cup **pasta cooking water**, then drain.

2. heat a large drizzle of **olive oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add **mushrooms** and cook, stirring, until browned, 5-7 minutes. add **shallot**, another drizzle of **olive oil**, and **chili flakes** to taste. cook, stirring, until shallot is softened, 2-3 minutes.

3. once shallot has softened, stir **tomatoes** into pan. reduce heat to low. stir in **sour cream**, **stock concentrate**, half the **parmesan**, and ⅓ cup reserved **pasta cooking water**. season with **salt**, **pepper**, chopped **parsley**, and a pinch more **chili flakes** if desired.

4. add **ravioli** to pan and increase heat to medium. gently stir to coat ravioli in sauce. cook until sauce thickens slightly, 1-2 minutes. if needed, stir in more reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until ravioli is coated in a creamy sauce.

5. divide ravioli mixture between plates. garnish with remaining **parmesan** and reserved **parsley leaves** and serve.
