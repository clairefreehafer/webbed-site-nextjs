#### ingredients

- 1.5 c jasmine rice
- 2 sweet potatoes, diced
- 16 oz cremini mushrooms, quartered
- 2 bell peppers, diced ½-inch
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced, separated
- 2 thumbs ginger, minced
- 4 tbsp hoisin sauce
- 4 tbsp mayonnaise
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tsp sriracha
- 2 tbsp sesame seeds
- 2 tsp vegetable oil
- 2 tbsp butter

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to top and middle positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees. melt 2 tbsp **butter** in a small pot over medium-high heat. add **scallion whites** and 2 TBSP minced **ginger**; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute. add **rice**, 2¼ cups **water**, and a pinch of **salt**. bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. keep covered off heat until ready to serve.

2. meanwhile, in a medium bowl, toss **sweet potato** and **mushrooms** with a drizzle of **oil**, half the **hoisin**, **salt**, and **pepper**. spread out on one baking sheet. toss **bell pepper** on empty side with a drizzle of **oil**; season with **salt** and **pepper**. roast until just tender, 15 minutes. (roast sweet potatoes and mushrooms on top rack and bell peppers on middle rack.)

3. hile veggies roast, in a small bowl, combine **mayonnaise**, **sour cream**, **soy sauce**, and as much **sriracha** as you like.

4. once veggies have roasted 15 minutes, remove baking sheet with sweet potatoes and mushrooms from oven. using a spatula, toss sweet potato and mushrooms with remaining hoisin and half the **sesame seeds**. return to oven until veggies are tender and glaze is tacky, 5-8 minutes more.

5. fluff **rice** with a fork and season with **salt**; divide between bowls. arrange **sweet potato**, **mushrooms**, and **bell pepper** on top in their own sections. drizzle everything with as much spicy soy mayo as you like. top with **scallion greens** and remaining **sesame seeds**. Serve.
