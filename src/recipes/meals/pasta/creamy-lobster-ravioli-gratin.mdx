3. stir ¼ cup **pasta water** into sauce in pan. season with **salt** and **pepper**. if sauce is very thick, stir in a little more pasta water. remove pan from heat. heat broiler to medium high. spread ⅓ of the sauce on the bottom of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish. scatter half the **tomatoes** inside dish. gently drain **ravioli**, then arrange in dish in an even layer. pour over remaining sauce and scatter remaining tomatoes over.

4. mix **panko** and **parmesan** in a small bowl, then sprinkle evenly over ravioli in dish. place dish under broiler. broil until toasted, about 3 minutes. set aside and let rest 5 minutes. heat a drizzle of **olive oil** in another large pan over medium-high heat. add **asparagus** and cook, tossing, until tender, about 5 minutes. add **garlic herb butter** and toss.

5. squeeze juice from **lemon** half over asparagus. season with **salt** and **pepper**. cut ravioli bake into squares and add to plates. sprinkle with **chives**. add asparagus to the side; pour any butter in pan over. sprinkle with **chili flakes** to taste. serve with **lemon** wedges.
