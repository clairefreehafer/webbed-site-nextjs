#### ingredients

- 4 lbs russet or yukon gold potatoes, 🔪 cut into quarters, sixths, or eighths depending on size (2-3 in per piece)
- 3 medium cloves garlic, 🔪 minced
- small handful fresh parsley leaves, 🔪 minced
- small handful picked fresh rosemary leaves, 🔪 finely chopped
- 5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, duck fat, goose fat, or beef fat
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- freshly ground black pepper
- kosher salt

#### instructions

1. adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 🔥 450°F (400°F if using convection).

1. heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large pot over 🔥 high heat until boiling.

1. add 2 tablespoons **kosher salt**, **baking soda**, and **potatoes** and stir. return to a 🔥 boil, reduce to a 🔥 simmer, and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about ⏲️ 10 minutes after returning to a boil.

1. meanwhile, combine **olive oil**, **duck fat**, or **beef fat** with **rosemary**, **garlic**, and a few grinds of **black pepper** in a small saucepan and heat over 🔥 medium heat. cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about ⏲️ 3 minutes. immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.

1. when potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about ⏲️ 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more **salt** and **pepper**, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.

1. transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for ⏲️ 20 minutes.

1. using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, ⏲️ 30 to 40 minutes longer.

1. transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and **minced parsley**. toss to coat and season with more **salt** and **pepper** to taste. serve immediately.
