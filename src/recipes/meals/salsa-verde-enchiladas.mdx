#### ingredients

- flour tortillas
- 26.8 oz black beans, drained, liquid reserved
- 2 poblano peppers, diced
- 2 roma tomatoes, finely diced
- 2 chili peppers, thinly sliced
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced
- 2 tbsp southwest spice blend
- 14.12 oz green salsa
- ½ c monterey jack cheese
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 2 tbsp butter

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 475 degrees. heat a drizzle of **oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add **poblano** and cook until just softened, 3-4 minutes.

2. reserve 1 tsp **southwest spice** in a second small bowl. once poblano is just softened, add **tomato**, **scallion whites**, half the **beans**, 4 tbsp reserved bean liquid, and remaining **southwest spice** to pan. cook, stirring, until fragrant and warmed through, 2-3 minutes. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

3. heat a large drizzle of **oil** in a small pot over medium-high heat. add remaining **beans** and cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. add ⅓ c reserved **bean liquid**. simmer until warmed through, 1-2 minutes. reduce heat to low and stir in 2 tbsp **butter**. turn off heat; mash with a potato masher or fork until mostly smooth. season with plenty of **salt** and **pepper**.

4. spread **tortillas** with mashed beans. place a small amount of filling on one half of each tortilla. roll up tortillas, starting with filled side, and place seam sides down in a baking dish or ovenproof pan. spoon enough **salsa** over to generously coat. sprinkle with **monterey jack**. bake on top rack until salsa is bubbly and cheese melts, 3-5 minutes.

5. add **sour cream** to bowl with reserved **southwest spice**. stir in **warm water** 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. season with **salt** and **pepper**. top baked enchiladas with crema, **scallion greens**, and as much **chili** as you like. divide between plates and serve.
