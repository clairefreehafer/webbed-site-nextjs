#### ingredients

- 1.5 c jasmine rice
- 2 limes, quartered
- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- 4 tbsp sour cream
- 2 avocados, diced (½-inch)
- 164g tempura mix
- 10 tsp white wine vinegar
- 2 persian cucumbers, quartered lengthwise, cut crosswise (½-inch)
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced, separated
- 4 tbsp mayonnaise
- 2 tsp sriracha
- 1 tsp korean chili flakes
- 12 oz green beans
- 1 tbsp sesame seeds
- 3 tsp sugar

#### instructions

1. in a medium pot, combine **rice**, 2¼ cups **water**, and a big pinch of both **salt** and **pepper**. bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. keep covered off heat until ready to serve.

2. in a medium bowl, combine **cucumber**, **scallion whites**, **soy sauce**, juice from half the **lime**, and 1 tsp **sugar**. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

3. in a small bowl, combine **mayonnaise**, **sour cream**, and **sriracha** to taste. toss **avocado** in a separate small bowl with a squeeze of **lime juice** to taste and a pinch of **chili flakes** to taste. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

4. pat **green beans** thoroughly dry with paper towels. in a large bowl, combine **tempura mix**, 2 tsp **salt**, and 2/3 cup **cold water**. stir green beans into batter until fully coated. if tempura batter is too thick (before adding green beans), stir in more water 1 tbsp at a time until it reaches a pancake-batter-like consistency.

5. heat a 1/3-inch layer of **oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. once oil is hot enough that a drop of batter sizzles when added to the pan, working in batches, add **coated green beans** in a single layer. cook, turning once or twice, until golden brown, 4-6 minutes. using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. season with **salt**. to help the batter stick, don’t flip your green beans until the first side is golden brown.

6. fluff **rice** with a fork; stir in 2 tsp **sugar** and **vinegar** to taste. season with **salt** and **pepper**. divide between bowls and top with **tempura green beans**, **marinated cucumber** (discarding liquid), **avocado**, and **sriracha mayo**. garnish with **scallion greens**, **sesame seeds**, and a pinch of **chili flakes** to taste.
