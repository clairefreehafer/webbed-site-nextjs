1. when the rice has cooled to room temperature, add it to the dressing along with the **chickpeas**, if desired, and stir with a fork until thoroughly combined. taste to see if it needs more lemon juice, then cover tightly and refrigerate until shortly before serving time.

1. within 15 minutes of serving, add the **scallions**, **parsley**, **pecans**, **grapes**, and **black pepper** to taste. Mix gently but completely, and serve.
