#### ingredients

- 4 sweet potatoes, cut into ½-inch cubes
- 2 red onions, cut into ½-inch wedges
- 8 oz grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise
- ½ oz cilantro, chopped, 1 tbsp set aside
- 1 tsp minced garlic
- 1 lemon, halved
- 2 avocados, cut into small cubes
- 1 thai chili, minced,
- 1 tsp cumin
- 8 oz grilling cheese

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. toss **sweet potatoes** and **onion** on a baking sheet with a drizzle of **olive oil** and a pinch of **salt** and **pepper**. roast, tossing halfway through, until browned and tender, about 25 minutes.

2. combine un-set-aside **cilantro**, ½ tsp **cumin**, a pinch of minced **garlic**, and a pinch of **chili** (to taste). stir in a squeeze of **lemon** and a large drizzle of **olive oil**. season with **salt**, **pepper**, and more **garlic** and **chili** as desired. add more **lemon** and **olive oil** as needed to give mixture a loose, drizzling consistency.

3. cut the **grilling cheese** into ⅓-inch-thick slices. heat a drizzle of **olive oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add **grilling cheese** and cook until browned, 1-2 minutes per side.

4. add **tomato**, **sweet potatoes**, **onion**, **avocado**, a squeeze of **lemon juice**, and a pinch of remaining **chili** (to taste) to bowl with reserved **cilantro**. toss to combine. divide between plates, then top with **grilling cheese**. drizzle with chimichurri and serve.
