#### ingredients

- 8 ounces pasta: shells or bowties (farfalle)
- 3 green onions (or ¼ teaspoon onion powder)
- ¼ cup minced red onion
- 2 5-ounce cans tuna
- ½ cup mayonnaise
- ¼ cup sour cream
- 1 ½ tablespoons white wine vinegar
- ½ teaspoon dried dill

#### instructions

1. start a pot of salted water to a boil. boil the **pasta** until it is just al dente. start tasting a few minutes before the package recommends: you want it to be tender but still a little firm on the inside; usually around 7 to 8 minutes. drain the pasta, then rinse with cold water.

2. meanwhile, thinly slice the **green onions**. mince the **red onion**. drain the **tuna** and flake it with a fork. place them in a large bowl with the **mayonnaise**, **sour cream**, **white vinegar**, **dill**, and **salt**.

3. once the pasta is cooked, add it to the bowl and mix. taste and adjust flavors if desired, adding **black pepper** as necessary. serve immediately. store leftovers refrigerated for up to 3 days: before eating, allow to come to room temperature. you may want to add a swirl of mayo or sour cream and a pinch of salt to refresh the texture and flavor.
