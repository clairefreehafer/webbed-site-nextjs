- 1 c jasmine rice
- 2 yellow onions, diced
- 2 roma tomatoes, diced
- 26.8 oz black beans, drained and rinsed
- 26.8 oz corn, drained and rinsed
- veggie stock
- 2 tbsp southwest spice blend
- 2 limes, zested and quartered
- 1/2 oz cilantro, finely chopped
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 1/2 c monterey jack cheese, shredded
- 2 tsp hot sauce
- 6 oz blue corn tortilla chips

#### instructions

1. melt 2 tbsp **butter** in a medium pot over medium-high heat. add **onion** and cook until softened, 4-5 minutes. stir in **rice**, **beans**, **stock** concentrate, and half the **southwest spice**. add 1Â½ cup **water** and a big pinch of **salt**. bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. keep covered off heat until ready to serve.

2. meanwhile, dry **corn** thoroughly with paper towels, removing as much moisture as possible. heat a large, preferably nonstick, pan over high heat. add corn and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly charred, 4-6 minutes. if corn begins to pop, cover pan. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

3. in a medium bowl, combine **corn**, **tomato**, half the **cilantro**, remaining **southwest spice**, a pinch of **lime zest**, a large drizzle of **olive oil**, and a squeeze of **lime juice** to taste. season with plenty of **salt** and **pepper**.

4. in a small bowl, combine **sour cream** and as much remaining **lime zest** and **juice** as you like. add **water** 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

5. luff rice mixture with a fork; season with **salt** and **pepper**. divide between bowls and top with salsa, **monterey jack**, and remaining **cilantro**. drizzle with crema and as much **hot sauce** as you like. serve with **tortilla chips** for dipping and any remaining **lime wedges** on the side.
