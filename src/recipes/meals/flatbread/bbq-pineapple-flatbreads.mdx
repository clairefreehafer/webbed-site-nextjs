1. once cooked onion is softened, increase heat under pan to 🔥 medium high. add **pineapple** and another drizzle of **oil**; cook, stirring, until pineapple is lightly browned, 2-3 minutes. stir in remaining **vinegar**. cook, stirring, until onion and pineapple are caramelized and jammy, ⏲️ 1-2 minutes more. turn off heat and season with **salt** and **pepper**.

1. brush or rub each **flatbread** with a drizzle of **oil**. remove prepared baking sheets from oven; carefully place flatbreads on them. evenly spread with **BBQ sauce**, then top with **caramelized onion** and **pineapple**, **poblano**, **monterey jack**, and **mozzarella**.

1. return flatbreads to top rack until cheese has melted and edges are golden brown, 🔥 10-12 minutes, swapping rack positions halfway through baking. transfer to a cutting board and top with **cilantro** and **pickled onion** (draining first) to taste. slice into pieces, divide between plates, and serve.
