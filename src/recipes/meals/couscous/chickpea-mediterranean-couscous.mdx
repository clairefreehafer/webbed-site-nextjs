#### ingredients

- 1 1/2 c couscous
- 13.4 oz chickpeas, drained, rinsed, as dry as possible
- 2 zucchinis, diced 1/2 in
- 8 oz grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced
- 1/4 oz thyme leaves
- 1 lemon, halved
- 1 c feta cheese
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

#### instructions

1. adjust racks to middle and top positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees. toss **zucchini**, **tomatoes**, and half the **thyme leaves** on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of **olive oil**. season with **salt** and **pepper**. roast on middle rack, tossing halfway through, until tender, 15-20 minutes.

2. on a second baking sheet, toss the **chickpeas** with **paprika**, a large drizzle of **olive oil**, and a pinch of **salt** and **pepper**. roast on top rack, tossing halfway through, until crisp, 18-20 minutes.

3. heat **butter**, **garlic**, and **scallion whites** in a medium pot over medium-high heat; cook until butter has melted and garlic is fragrant, 1 minute. add **couscous** and remaining **thyme leaves**; stir to coat. season with **salt** and **pepper**. cook, stirring, until couscous is lightly toasted, 2-3 minutes.

4. add **stock concentrate** and 1Â½ cups **water** to pot with couscous. bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. cook until couscous is tender, 6-8 minutes. drain any excess water, if necessary. keep covered off heat.

5. add half the veggies, half the **feta**, and a squeeze of **lemon juice **to pot with couscous; stir to combine. season with **salt** and **pepper**. divide between plates; top with crispy chickpeas and remaining veggies. garnish with **scallion greens** and remaining **feta**. serve.
