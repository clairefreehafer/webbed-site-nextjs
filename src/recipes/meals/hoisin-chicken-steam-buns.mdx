2. pat the **chicken** dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper. in a medium nonstick pan, heat a drizzle of **olive oil** on medium-high until hot. add the seasoned chicken in an even layer and cook, without stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned. continue to cook, stirring frequently, 3 to 4 minutes, or until browned and cooked through. turn off the heat. transfer to a large bowl. add the **hoisin sauce**; stir to coat. cover with foil to keep warm.
