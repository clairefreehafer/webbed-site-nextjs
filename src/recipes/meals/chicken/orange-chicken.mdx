- 10 oz boneless chicken breast
  - cut into bite-sized cubes
- 2 cloves garlic
  - minced
- 1/2 c orange juice
- 1/2 tsp orange zest
- 1 tbsp garlic chili sauce
- 3 tbsp chicken broth
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp sugar
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar, red wine or chinese white vinegar
- 1 tsp cornstarch
- 1 egg white
- 1/2 c all-purpose flour, sifted

#### instructions

1. in a bowl, mix **orange juice**, **orange zest**, **garlic chili sauce**, **chicken broth**, **soy sauce**, **sugar**, **vinegar**, 1 tsp **cornstarch** and a pinch of **salt** and whisk to combine well.

1. in another bowl, whisk **egg white**, **flour**, 1/4 c **cornstarch**, **baking powder**, 1/3 c ice-cold **water**, 1 tbsp **cooking oil**, and a pinch of **salt** until the batter is smooth. drop in the **chicken** cubes, coat them well, and set aside.

1. heat a wok or non-stick skillet with oil. gently drop in the battered chicken cubes one by one, ensuring they are spread out to prevent sticking and overcrowding the wok or skillet.

1. deep-fry the chicken pieces until they turn golden brown and become crispy. remove them using a strainer and drain on paper towels.

1. transfer the deep-frying oil to a container, leaving 1 tablespoon in the wok or skillet. add the **garlic** and stir-fry until aromatic or light brown in color. gently pour in the orange sauce mixture, stir, and bring it to a light simmer.

1. toss in the deep-fried chicken and stir to combine well. dish out, garnish with **orange slices**, sprinkle with white **sesame seeds**, and serve immediately with steamed **rice**.
