### ingredients

- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 8 oz. baby bella mushrooms, sliced
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp freshly cracked pepper
- 8 oz. fettuccine
- 2.5 cups vegetable broth
- 1/3 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup grated parmesan

#### instructions

1. add the **butter** and **garlic** to a deep skillet and sauté over medium heat for one minute. add the sliced **mushrooms**, **salt**, and **pepper**, and continue to sauté until the mushrooms have softened, all of their moisture has evaporated from the skillet, and the edges are beginning to brown.

2. add the **fettuccine** to the skillet along with the **vegetable broth** and stir to combine. it's okay if the broth doesn't fully submerge the pasta.

3. place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow the broth to come up to a boil. when it reaches a boil, give the pasta a quick stir, replace the lid, then turn the heat down to medium-low.

4. continue to let the pasta simmer in the broth for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally (always replacing the lid), or until the pasta is tender. there should be a little saucy liquid left in the bottom of the skillet.

5. add the **heavy cream** to the skillet and stir to combine. turn the heat off then add the **parmesan** and continue to stir the pasta until the parmesan is melted. give the pasta a taste and add **salt** or **pepper** if needed. serve immediately.
