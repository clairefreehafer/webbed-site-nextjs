#### ingredients

- 1.5 c farro
- 12 oz asparagus
- 2 zucchini, thinly sliced into rounds
- 2 yellow onions, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 lemon, zested and halved
- 1/2 cup parmesan cheese
- 1 oz walnuts
- veggie stock
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp butter

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. in a medium pot, combine **farro**, **stock** concentrates, and 6 cups **water**. bring to a boil and cook until farro is tender, 25-30 minutes total. if you end up with any excess stock, simply pour it out. alternatively, if stock evaporates before farro is done, add a splash of water.

2. cut off **asparagus** tips and set aside; chop stalks into Â½-inch pieces. peel and mince or grate garlic. cut one half of the **lemon** into wedges.

3. toss **asparagus tips** and **zucchini** on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of **olive oil**. season generously with **salt** and **pepper**. roast on middle rack, tossing halfway through, until browned and tender, 15-20 minutes.

4. while veggies roast, heat a drizzle of **olive oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add **onion** and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and translucent, 3-4 minutes. add **garlic** and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds.

5. when **farro** has 5 minutes left (grains should be just shy of al dente), stir chopped **asparagus stalks** into pot. once everything is tender, drain farro and asparagus, then add to pan with onion and garlic. stir in half the **lemon zest**, **juice** from lemon half, half the **parmesan**, and 2 tbsp **butter**. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

6. divide farro mixture between bowls. top with zucchini and asparagus tips. sprinkle with **walnuts**, remaining **parmesan**, and remaining **lemon zest**. serve with **lemon wedges** on the side.
