#### ingredients

- sourdough
- 26.8 oz chickpeas, drained, rinsed, dried
- 24 oz potatoes, cut into ½-in-thick wedges
- 2 tomatoes, thinly sliced into rounds
- 4 scallions, thinly sliced
- 1 lemon, quartered
- 1 c guacamole
- ½ oz parsley, finely chopped

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. toss **potatoes** on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of **oil**, **garlic powder**, **onion powder**, **paprika**, **salt**, and **pepper**. roast on top rack until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes.

2. season **tomato** with salt and pepper.

3. place **chickpeas** in a medium bowl and mash with a potato masher or fork until about half the chickpeas are smooth (leave some larger pieces for texture). add **scallion greens**, **parsley**, **guacamole**, **garlic powder**, a large drizzle of **olive oil**, and as much **lemon juice** as you like. season generously with **salt** and **pepper**. stir until combined.

4. brush each side of **sourdough** slices with a drizzle of **olive oil**. heat a large pan over medium-high heat. add bread; toast until golden brown, 2-3 minutes per side

5. top half the toasted sourdough with chickpea salad and seasoned tomato. close sandwiches and halve on a diagonal. divide sandwiches and potato wedges between plates. Serve.
