#### ingredients

- 4 slices sourdough bread
- 1 sweet potato, sliced into ¼-inch-thick rounds
- 1 tbsp fry seasoning
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- ¼ oz cilantro, roughly chopped
- 1 mini cucumber, halved lengthwised, sliced into ¼-inch-thick half-moons
- 5 tsp white wine Vinegar
- 5 oz baby spinach
- ½ oz sliced almonds
- 2 tbsp chipotle mayonnaise

- 1 tsp sugar

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. toss **sweet potato** on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, half the **fry seasoning**, **salt**, and **pepper**. roast on top rack until browned and tender, 18-20 minutes. • Meanwhile, halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. Roughly chop cilantro. Halve cucumber lengthwise; slice into ¼-inch-thick half-moons.

2. heat a drizzle of **oil** in a medium, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. add **onion**; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and softened, 8-10 minutes. add 1 tsp **sugar** and a splash of **water**; cook until caramelized, 2-3 minutes more. season with **salt** and **pepper**. in a large bowl, combine **vinegar**, **cilantro**, **cucumber**, ½ tsp **sugar**, 2 tbsp **olive oil**, **salt**, and **pepper**. set aside.

3. heat 1 tbsp **olive oil** in a large pan over medium heat. add **sourdough** slices; toast until golden brown, 2-3 minutes per side. transfer to a cutting board. add ¾ of the **spinach** and **almonds** to bowl with cucumber mixture; toss to combine. season with **salt** and **pepper** to taste.

4. spread half the sourdough slices with **chipotle mayo**. spread remaining sourdough slices with **guacamole**. fill with even layers of sweet potato, onion, and as much remaining **spinach** as you like. close sandwiches and cut in half crosswise. divide sandwiches and salad between plates and serve.
