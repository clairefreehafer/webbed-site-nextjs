#### ingredients

- 18 oz. cavatappi or gemelli pasta
- 24 oz button mushrooms, sliced 1⁄4-inch thick
- 6 scallions, thinly sliced, spearated
- 3 tbsp flour
- 20 oz milk
- 6 tbsp cream cheese
- 6 tbsp garlic herb butter
- 9 tbsp parmesan cheese
- 6 tbsp butter

#### instructions

1. bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. once water is boiling, add **pasta** to pot. cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. reserve 1 cup **pasta cooking water**, then drain.

2. heat a large drizzle of **olive oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add **mushrooms**; season with **salt** and **pepper**. cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and slightly crispy, 5-7 minutes. turn off heat; transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. wash out pan.

3. while pasta cooks, melt 6 tbsp plain **butter** in pan used for mushrooms over medium-high heat. add **scallion whites** and cook until just softened, 1 minute. add **flour** and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, 1-2 minutes. whisk in **milk** and 1⁄2 cup reserved **pasta cooking water**, breaking up any flour clumps. simmer until slightly thickened, 3-4 minutes.

4. stir **cream cheese** into pan with sauce until melted and combined. stir in mushrooms, drained pasta, and **garlic herb butter**. season with **salt** and **pepper**. if needed, stir in more reserved cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is coated in a creamy sauce.

5. divide pasta between bowls and sprinkle with **parmesan** and **scallion greens**. Serve.
