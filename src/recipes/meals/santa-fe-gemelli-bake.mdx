#### ingredients

- 12 oz gemelli pasta
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 2 long green peppers, diced
- 2 jalapeños, minced
- 2 tbsp southwest spice blend
- 2 tbsp flour
- 28 oz diced tomatoes
- 1 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1 cup mexican cheese blend
- 1/2 cup monterey jack cheese
- 8 tbsp cream cheese
- 1 tsp hot sauce
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 4 tbsp butter

#### instructions

1. heat broiler to high or oven to 500 degrees.

2. heat a large drizzle of **olive oil** in a large, preferably ovenproof, pot over medium-high heat. add **onion**, **green pepper**, and **jalapeño** to taste. cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 3-4 minutes. stir in 2 tbsp **butter** until melted. add **southwest spice**, **flour**, **salt**, and **pepper**; cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute.

3. stir 3 cups **water** and **diced tomatoes** into same pan. bring to a boil, then add **gemelli**. cook, stirring occasionally, until pasta is al dente and liquid is absorbed, 9-11 minutes. if needed, stir in a splash of water until pasta is coated in sauce.

4. meanwhile, place 2 tbsp **butter** in a medium microwave-safe bowl; microwave until melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. add **panko** and **mexican cheese**. season with **salt** and **pepper**; mix to thoroughly combine. set aside.

5. stir **cream cheese** and **monterey jack** into gemelli mixture until combined. season with **salt** and **pepper**; turn off heat. if your pan isn’t ovenproof, or if you used a pot, transfer mixture now to a baking dish. evenly sprinkle pan or dish with panko mixture.

6. broil or bake pasta until golden brown and bubbly, 3-5 minutes. watch carefully to avoid burning. divide between bowls and serve. if you like things spicy, drizzle with **hot sauce** to taste and top with as much remaining **jalapeño** as you like.
