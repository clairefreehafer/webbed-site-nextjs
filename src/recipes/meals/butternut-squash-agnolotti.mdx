#### ingredients

- 1 yellow onion, thinly sliced
- 4 oz kale
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- ¼ ounce sage leaves, roughly chopped
- 18 ounce butternut squash agnolotti
- 1 oz walnuts
- 4 tbsp garlic herb butter
- ½ cup parmesan cheese
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp olive oil

#### instructions

1. bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. remove and discard any large stems from **kale**.

2. heat a large drizzle of **olive oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add sliced **onion** and cook until slightly softened, 3-4 minutes. add the **kale**; season with **salt** and **pepper**. cook, stirring, until tender, 5-7 minutes. if necessary, add a splash of water to help soften kale. stir in **garlic** and another drizzle of **olive oil**. cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. remove from pan; set aside.

3. once water is boiling, add **agnolotti** to pot. lower heat slightly and let water come to a gentle boil. cook until agnolotti are tender and floating to the top, 3-5 minutes. reserve 1 cup **pasta cooking water**, then drain.

4. while pasta cooks, melt 2 tbsp **plain butter** in pan used for kale over medium heat. add **sage** and **walnuts**. cook, stirring, until walnuts smell toasty and butter is foamy and flecked with amber brown bits, 1-2 minutes.

5. stir drained agnolotti, kale mixture, and ⅓ cup reserved pasta cooking water into pan. increase heat to high and let bubble until liquid is reduced by half, 2-3 minutes. if needed, add more reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until agnolotti are coated in sauce. stir in **garlic herb butter** and half the **parmesan**. taste and season with **salt** and **pepper**.

6. divide pasta between bowls. sprinkle with remaining **parmesan** and serve.
