#### ingredients

- 1.5 c farro
- 12 oz asparagus
  - stalks chopped into ½-inch pieces, tips set aside
- 2 zucchini
  - thinly sliced into rounds
- 2 yellow onions
  - finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic
  - minced
- 1 lemon
  - zested and halved
- ½ cup parmesan cheese
  - shredded
- 1 oz walnuts
- veggie stock
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 2 tbsp butter

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 🔥 450 degrees.

1. in a medium pot, combine **farro**, **stock** concentrates, and 6 cups **water**. bring to a 🔥 boil and cook until farro is tender, ⏲️ 25-30 minutes total. if you end up with any excess stock, simply pour it out. alternatively, if stock evaporates before farro is done, add a splash of water.

1. toss **asparagus tips** and **zucchini** on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of **olive oil**. season generously with **salt** and **pepper**. roast on middle rack, tossing halfway through, until browned and tender, ⏲️ 15-20 minutes.

1. while veggies roast, heat a drizzle of **olive oil** in a large pan over 🔥 medium-high heat. add **onion** and cook, stirring frequently, until softened and translucent, ⏲️ 3-4 minutes. add **garlic** and cook, stirring, until fragrant, ⏲️ 30 seconds.

1. when **farro** has ⏲️ 5 minutes left (grains should be just shy of al dente), stir chopped **asparagus stalks** into pot. once everything is tender, drain farro and asparagus, then add to pan with onion and garlic. stir in half the **lemon zest**, **juice** from lemon half, half the **parmesan**, and 2 tbsp **butter**. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

1. divide farro mixture between bowls. top with zucchini and asparagus tips. sprinkle with **walnuts**, remaining **parmesan**, and remaining **lemon zest**. serve with **lemon wedges** on the side.
