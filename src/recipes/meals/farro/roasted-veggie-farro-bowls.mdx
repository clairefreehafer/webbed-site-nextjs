1. in a small bowl, combine juice from four **lemon wedges** and 2 tsp **sugar**. stir in **cranberries**. let marinate, stirring occasionally, at least ⏲️ 15 minutes.

1. once cranberries have marinated, transfer lemon juice marinade to a second large bowl (leaving cranberries in small bowl). whisk 2 tbsp **olive oil** into bowl with marinade; taste and season with **salt** and **pepper**.

1. stir 4 tbsp **butter**, half the roasted veggies, and half the dressing into pot with farro. season with **salt** and **pepper**. to bowl with remaining dressing, add **arugula**, **cranberries**, and remaining roasted veggies; toss to coat. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

1. divide farro mixture between bowls. top with salad. sprinkle with **parmesan**, **pepitas**, and as much **lemon zest** as you like. serve with remaining **lemon wedges** on the side.
