3. lower heat under same pan to medium-high, then add **tomatoes** and a drizzle of **oil**. cook until tomatoes are starting to blister, 3-4 minutes, tossing frequently. set aside with collard greens.

4. heat another drizzle of **oil** in same pan over medium-high heat. season **shrimp** with **salt**, **pepper** and a pinch of **chili flakes**. add to pan and cook until opaque, 4-5 minutes, tossing. return collard greens and tomatoes to pan. toss until warmed through.

5. add cheddar and **butter** to grits and stir until melted. season generously with **salt** and **pepper**. divide grits between plates, then top with shrimp, collard greens, and tomatoes.
