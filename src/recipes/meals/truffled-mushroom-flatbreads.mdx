#### instructions

1. place 2 foil-lined baking sheets on top and middle rack and preheat oven to 425 degrees.

2. heat a large drizzle of **olive oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add **mushrooms**, **shallot**, and half the **italian seasoning**. cook, stirring, until browned and softened, 8-10 minutes. season with **salt** and **pepper**; remove pan from heat.

3. remove preheated baking sheets from oven and carefully place **flatbreads** on them. top with **cheese**, remaining **italian seasoning**, and mushroom mixture. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

4. bake flatbreads on top and middle racks until cheese is melted and crust is golden, 7-9 minutes. swap rack positions halfway through baking. remove from oven, then drizzle with **truffle oil** to taste.

5. while flatbreads bake, in a medium bowl, toss **arugula** with a drizzle of **olive oil** and a squeeze of **lemon juice** to taste. season with **salt** and **pepper**.

6. slice flatbreads into pieces. divide between plates and serve with salad on the side. if you like, you can top your flatbreads with the salad instead.
