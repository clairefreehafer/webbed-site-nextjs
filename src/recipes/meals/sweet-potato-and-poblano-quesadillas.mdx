#### ingredients

- 4 flour tortillas
- 2 sweet potatoes, diced (½-inch)
- 2 poblano peppers, diced
- 2 yellow onions, 2 tbsp minced, rest diced
- 1/2 oz cilantro, finely chopped
- 2 roma tomatoes, diced
- 6 radishes, finely diced
- 1 lime, quartered
- 2 tbsp southwest spice blend
- 8 tbsp sour cream
- 1 c cheddar cheese, shredded
- 1 c mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 tsp olive oil

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. toss **sweet potato** on a baking sheet with a drizzle of **oil**, **salt**, and **pepper**. roast on top rack, tossing halfway through, until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes. remove roasted sweet potato from sheet.

2. place ½ tsp **southwest spice** in a small bowl.

3. heat a drizzle of **oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add **poblano** and diced **onion**; season with **salt** and **pepper**. cook, stirring, until tender, 5-7 minutes. once sweet potato is done roasting, add to pan along with remaining southwest spice. cook until fragrant, 1 minute. turn off heat.

4. in a medium bowl, combine **radishes**, **tomato**, **cilantro**, **minced onion**, a squeeze of **lime juice**, and a large drizzle of **olive oil**. season generously with **salt** and **pepper**. to bowl with reserved southwest spice, add **sour cream**, a squeeze of **lime juice**, and a pinch of **salt**. stir in **water** 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.

5. place **tortillas** on a clean work surface. in a second small bowl, combine **cheddar** and **mozzarella**. sprinkle half the cheese mixture onto one half of each tortilla. top with cooked veggies, then sprinkle with remaining cheese mixture. fold tortillas in half to create quesadillas.

6. wash out pan used for veggies. heat a drizzle of **oil** in pan over medium-high heat; add quesadillas and cook until tortillas are golden brown and cheese melts, 2-4 minutes per side. cut quesadillas into wedges and divide between plates. top with salsa and crema. serve with remaining **lime wedges** on the side.
