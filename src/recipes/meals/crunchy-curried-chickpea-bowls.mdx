#### ingredients

- 26.8 oz chickpeas
- 8 oz kale leaves, finely chopped
- 6 oz carrot, quartered lengthwise and cut crosswise ¼-inch-thick
- 2 lemons, zested and quartered
- 2 oz golden raisins
- 2 tbsp curry powder
- vegetable stock
- 8 oz red cabbage, shredded
- 12 tbsp sour cream
- 4 tsp olive oil
- 2 tsp sugar
- 6 tbsp butter

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. place **raisins** in a small bowl with enough **hot water** to just cover.

2. toss **chickpeas** on a baking sheet with half the **curry powder**, a large drizzle of **olive oil**, **salt**, and **pepper**. roast on top rack until crispy, 18-20 minutes.

3. while chickpeas roast, heat a small pot over high heat. add 2 tbsp **butter**, **carrot**, and ½ tsp **curry powder**. cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1-2 minutes. add **rice**, 1¾ cup **water**, **stock** concentrate, and a big pinch of **salt**. bring to a boil; cover and reduce to a low simmer. cook until tender, 15-18 minutes. keep covered off heat.

4. meanwhile, add 2 tsp **sugar** and **juice** from 6 lemon wedges to a medium microwave-safe bowl; stir to dissolve. add **cabbage** and 4 tbsp **water**; season with **salt** and **pepper**. microwave for 1 minute. set aside, tossing occasionally. in a second small bowl, combine **sour cream**, **lemon zest**, remaining **curry powder**, and **juice** from remaining lemon. season with **salt** and **pepper**. add **water** 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency.

5. heat a large drizzle of **olive oil** in a large pan over medium-high heat. add **kale** and season with **salt** and **pepper**. cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 5-7 minutes. stir in 2 tbsp **butter** until melted. remove from heat.

6. fluff rice with a fork; stir in 2 tbsp butter and season with **salt** and **pepper**. divide between bowls. drain raisins. top rice with kale, pickled cabbage, and chickpeas. sprinkle with **raisins**, roughly chopping first if desired. drizzle with dressing and serve.
