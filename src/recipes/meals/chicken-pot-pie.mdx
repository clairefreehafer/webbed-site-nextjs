- 1 cup (about 130g) sliced carrots (about 2 carrots)
- 1/2 cup (about 40g) sliced celery
- 1/3 cup (5 Tbsp; 71g) unsalted butter
- 1/3 cup (45g) chopped yellow onion (1/2 of a small onion)
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 1/3 cup (41g) all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
- 1 and 3/4 cups (420ml) reduced sodium chicken broth/stock
- 2/3 cup (160ml) half-and-half
- egg wash: 1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon (15ml) milk

#### instructions

1. in a large pot, combine **chicken**, **carrots**, and **celery**. add enough water to cover the chicken and vegetables, then place over medium-high heat. bring to a boil, then allow to boil for 10 minutes. remove from heat, drain, and set aside.

2. in a large skillet over medium heat, combine the **butter**, **onions**, and **garlic**. stirring occasionally, cook until the onions are translucent and the butter is lightly browning. whisk in the **flour**, **salt**, **black pepper**, **thyme**, **chicken broth**, and **half-and-half**. cook and whisk until no flour lumps remain, then simmer over medium-low heat until thick, about 10 minutes. you want it to be a very thick gravy; simmer longer if necessary. taste and add more seasonings if you prefer. remove from heat and set aside.

3. preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).

4. spoon the chicken and vegetable mixture into the crust. pour/spread the gravy evenly over top.

5. cover the pie with the second crust and trim the extra overhang off the sides. crimp the pie crust with a fork to seal the edges. with a small sharp knife, slice a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape. using a pastry brush, brush crust and edges with **egg wash**.

7. bake for 32–38 minutes or until the top of the crust is golden brown. after 20 minutes of baking, be sure to cover the edges of the crust with aluminum foil or use a pie crust shield to prevent the edges from getting too brown.

8. remove from the oven and cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.
