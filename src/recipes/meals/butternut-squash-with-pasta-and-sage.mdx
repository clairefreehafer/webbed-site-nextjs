5. in a large skillet over medium-low heat, melt the **butter**. add the **sage leaves** and cook until the butter begins to brown and the leaves crisp. remove the leaves with a slotted spoon to a paper-towel-lined-plate. be careful not to burn the butter.

8. toss with 1/2 cup of shredded **parmesan cheese**, adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. serve with more parmesan and lemon wedge, if desired.
