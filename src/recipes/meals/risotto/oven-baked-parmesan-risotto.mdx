#### ingredients

- 1 ½ c arborio rice

- 8 oz grape tomatoes, halved lengthwise
- 2 zucchinis, peeled into ribbons, core diced
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced
- 6 cups vegetable stock
- 2 tbsp italian seasoning
- 10 tsp balsamic vinegar
- 2 lemons, 2 tbsp zest then cut into wedges
- ½ c parmesan cheese
- 4 tbsp butter

#### instructions

1. adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 400 degrees.

2. heat 2 tbsp **butter** and a large drizzle of **olive oil** in a large lidded oven-save pot or pan over medium-high heat. add **garlic** and **zucchini core** and cook, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. add **rice** and **italian seasoning** and cook, stirring, until rice is translucent, 1-2 minutes.

3. pour **stock** into pot and stir to combine. bring to a boil, then cover and carefully transfer to oven. bake until **rice** is tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 20-25 minutes.

4. place **shallots** and **tomatoes** on a large piece of aluminum foil. lift and crimp sides of foil to make a bowl. pour in **vinegar** and a large drizzle of **olive oil**. season with **salt** and **pepper**. place on a baking sheet and roast until shallots and tomatoes are softened and juicy, 15-20 minutes.

5. once risotto is tender, remove from oven and remove lid. place pot over medium-low heat. stir in **zucchini ribbons** and cook, stirring often, until tender, 3-5 minutes. stir in half the roasted shallots and tomatoes along with any roasting liquid. remove from heat. stir in 2 tbsp **butter**, half the **parmesan**, and juice from 4 **lemon wedges**. taste and season with **salt** and **pepper**.

6. divide risotto between plates. top with remaining shallots and tomatoes. sprinkle with **lemon zest** and remaining parmesan. serve with remaining lemon wedges.
